# Ripliel v1.1.0 Feedback

#### Critical Feedback

Please read the human/[Ripliel.md](http://Ripliel.md) and address the following concerns regarding differences.

1. When I resize the page, the anchor color and shape does change. According to the original specs, this is supposed to remain the same, though the anchored line may shift up and down slightly. This is because the anchor is based on the content of the sentence that is anchored (hash), not the visual line that is being annotated. The line is still the one being anchored from start to middle to end, yet the content of the sentence causing the anchor to be placed is what determines the type of anchor (which is consistent with page resizing).

#### New Features

1. Currently the first line of text is not annotated with the anchor. Please always anchor the first line of text.  
2. Please change the default number of lines to 2 rather than 3\.  
2. Please allow for the fallback font to also be configured.  
3. Please create an information page named something appropriate which can be accessed in the popup, which explains what the extension is, how it can help. Please reference and link any research that can potentially support the benefits of using the extension.
